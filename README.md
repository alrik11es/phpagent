## PHP Agent
A PHP agent designed to listen for hooks and trigger actions on the server. 

    This program is a concept and still under development.
    Please do not use it for production environments.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.0+

## Installation PHAR build

When the releases start to come we will build phar files in order to ease the process of
installing.

    # curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    # mv phpagent.phar /usr/local/bin/phpagent

Once you're finished you can now execute:
    
    $ phpagent

## Installation from scratch

You're gonna need composer for this one.

    # curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    # mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
    # git clone https://github.com/alrik11es/phpagent
    # composer install
    
Once you're finished all this commands you can now execute:

    $ ./bin/phpagent

### Daemon mode
You can use programs like [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) to let this program run in daemon mode.

## Events
This are triggers fired from other applications. For example an event could be the reception of a hook.

## Actions
When a event is fired. The action will be performed. You can have many actions as you want.

```json
{
  "actions": [{
    "name": "example-copy-action",
    "event": "startup",
    "action": "shell",
    "params": "cp /usr/local/file.txt /usr/local/file2.txt"
  }]
}
```

## Hooks
A hook is a specialized type of action that enables a React HTTP server to listen for specific requests. Like POST, GET or whatever. When the hook is fired then the action is performed.

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
      "name": "example-copy-hook",
      "route": "/api/hook",
      "action": "shell",
      "params": "cp /usr/local/file.txt /usr/local/file2.txt"
  }]
}
```
        
## Plugins
There will be plugins. Stay in touch.

### Creating your own plugins
As this cannot be really useful unless you can deploy new plugins to work with your agents we have created a way you can create the plugins with the most simple way possible.
